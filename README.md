## 629 Data Viz Final Project - Covid-19 in the U.S. by Region

This repository contains R source code as well as a dataset from census.gov to reproduce graphs that are presented in my infographic (also in the repository).

All current and new cases on the infographic are as of May 10th. Running the R script will produce graphs with the newest up to date data as the dataset is updated daily.

### To Run:
You must have the following R packages installed: readr, ggplot2, dplyr, sf, maps, ggthemes, tidyverse, wesanderson.

To do this, you can run:
install.packages(c("readr", "ggplot2", "sf", "maps", "ggthemes", "tidyverse", "wesanderson")) 

In R studio, run the code line by line. This will gather all of the data, generate information presented on the infographic, and at the end of the file, will produce all three graphs.

### Infographic
The infographic displays information showing how the U.S. is affected by Covid-19, divided into 3 regions.
