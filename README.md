## 629 Data Viz Final Project - Covid-19 in the U.S. by Region

This repository contains R source code as well as a dataset from census.gov to reproduce graphs that are presented in my infographic (also in the repository).

All current and new cases on the infographic are as of May 10th. Running the R script will provide the newest up to date information as the dataset is updated daily.

### To Run:
In R studio, run the code line by line. This will gather all of the data into dataframes, generate information presented on the infographic, and at the end of the file, will produce all three graphs.

### Infographic
The infographic displays information showing how the U.S. is affected by Covid-19, divided into 3 regions.
